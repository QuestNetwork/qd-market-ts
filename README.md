## qDesk Social

## Description

qDesk Market is a module for [qDesk](https://qDesk.org). It's accessible across qDesk, you can use it with qDesk Messages, qDesk Social and other qDesk modules. This module allows peers on the network to exchange physical goods, virtual goods and allows the scheduled booking of services.

It's not all qDesk though, qDesk Social is a protocol as well and if you are using [Quest OS](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/quest-os-js) in your applications, you can even use the underlying channels and data in your own application by booting with [Quest Social JS](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/quest-social-js).

qDesk Market offers the ability to offer your products and services commission free on a local and global level. You can have several stores, stores can be set to private or linked to a social profile. qDesk Market is a module for [qDesk](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qDesk) and it's built on [Quest OS](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/quest-os-js) which makes use of the [Interplanetary Filesystem](https://ipfs.io), [IPFS GossipSub](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-05-20-gossipsub-v1.1/) and [qDesk](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qDesk), our window platform based on [Angular10](https://angular.io/).

We're not planning to make this a decentralized version of "Amazon" or "Walmart". We're creating the real deal, a fully transparent and open source marketplace that cuts out the middle men.

[qDesk](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qDesk) works in the browser, as an Electron on Windows, Mac and Linux and Android using Cordova.

## Development

qDesk Social is a module of [qDesk](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qDesk), so please see https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qDesk#development for instructions.

### Commands

**Prepare Package**

``npm run inst`` Removes `package-lock.json` and runs ``npm install``

We added an example ```swarm.json``` to the ```src/app``` folder with an example node to make reproduction easier, but we strongly recommend to use our [Quest CLI](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/quest-cli) to test and build the app.

Pro Tip: Put a file in your `/bin` that runs the quest-cli like so `node /path/to/quest-cli/index.js` from any folder on your system. It's much nicer!
